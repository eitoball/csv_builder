# CSV Builder

The CSV Builder Rails plugin provides a simple templating system for serving dynamically generated CSV files from your
application.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eitoball/csv_builder.svg?branch=rails4)](https://travis-ci.org/eitoball/csv_builder)

## Requirements

The current version of CSV Builder works with:

* Rails 3.2 ~ 4.2
* Ruby 2.0 or above
* Unicorn _is required for streaming_ see [the example streaming app](https://github.com/fawce/test_csv_streamer) for more details.

## Install

### Install as a gem (recommended)

    $ gem install csv_builder

If you are using Bundler then [you know what to do](http://gembundler.com).



## Example

CSV template files are suffixed with `.csv.csvbuilder`, for example `index.csv.csvbuilder`

Add rows to your CSV file in the template by pushing arrays of columns into the csv object.

     # First row
     csv << [ 'cell 1', 'cell 2' ]
     # Second row
     csv << [ 'another cell value', 'and another' ]
     # etc...

You can set the default filename for that a browser will use for 'save as' by setting `@filename` instance variable in
your controller's action method e.g.

    @filename = 'report.csv'

You can set the input encoding and output encoding by setting `@input_encoding` and `@output_encoding` instance
variables.  These default to 'UTF-8' and 'ISO-8859-1' respectively. e.g.

    @output_encoding = 'UTF-8'

You can set `@csv_options` instance variable to define options for FasterCSV generator. For example: 

    @csv_options = { :force_quotes => true, :col_sep => ';' }

You can optionally stream your results line by line as they are generated. Results will stream if the underlying Rack server supports streaming, otherwise the results will be buffered and sent when the template finishes rendering. Just set `@streaming` to true:

    @streaming = true

You can respond with csv in your controller as well:

    respond_to do |format|
      format.html
      format.csv # make sure you have action_name.csv.csvbuilder template in place
    end 

You can also attach a csv file to mail sent out by your application by
including a snippet like the following in your mailer method

    attachment "text/csv" do |attachment|
      attachment.body = render(:file => 'example/index.csv.csvbuilder')
      attachment.filename = 'report.csv'
    end

## Streaming Support

Many csv files are quite large, and need to be streamed rather than return in a single shot. Csv stream handling is based on [an epic answer on stackoverflow about rails and streaming.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3507594/ruby-on-rails-3-streaming-data-through-rails-to-client). Streaming requires configuration of your rails app - you need to use a Rack that supports streaming. I've tested with Unicorn, and created [a separate sample](https://github.com/fawce/test_csv_streamer) project to facilitate testing on Heroku. 


## Contributions

The requirements are in the Gemfile within the test spec directory.  You will need Bundler installed and then you can run:

    cd spec/rails_app && bundle install && cd ../..

To install the main testing requirements.  Then return back to the root directory and run:

    rake spec
